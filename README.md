Python Programs: Dictionary Operations and List Slicing
1. Introduction

This repository contains Python programs that demonstrate the use of dictionary data structures and list slicing techniques. These programs help in understanding how data can be stored, retrieved, manipulated, and displayed efficiently using Python’s built-in data types.

2. Objectives

The objectives of this assignment are:

To understand the concept of dictionaries in Python.

To store and retrieve values using keys.

To handle cases where a key is not present in a dictionary.

To learn list creation and slicing techniques.

To perform list reversal using slicing.

3. Program Descriptions
3.1 Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

Creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values.

Takes a student’s name as input from the user.

Retrieves and displays the corresponding marks.

Displays an appropriate message if the student’s name is not found.

Description

This program uses a dictionary to store student names and their marks. The user provides a student name, and the program checks whether the name exists in the dictionary. If found, the corresponding marks are displayed; otherwise, a suitable message is shown.

Sample Output
Enter the student's name: Neha
Marks of Neha: 92


If the student is not found:

Enter the student's name: Karan
Student not found in the records.

3.2 Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

Extracts the first five elements from the list.

Reverses the extracted elements.

Prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

Description

This program demonstrates list slicing by extracting a subset of elements from a list and reversing them using slicing notation. It helps in understanding how lists can be efficiently manipulated without using loops.

Sample Output
Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

4. Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Python Version: Python 3.x

5. How to Execute the Programs

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory containing the Python files.

Run the program using:

python filename.py

6. Conclusion

These programs successfully demonstrate the use of dictionaries for data storage and retrieval, as well as list slicing techniques for extracting and reversing data. They provide a strong foundation for understanding Python’s core data structures.
